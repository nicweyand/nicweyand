# Hiya! I'm Nic Weyand! üëã

## TLDR:
I'm an enthusiastic developer on a journey of continuous learning and growth. My passion lies in creating practical, useful solutions that can make a difference in everyday life and industry. Guided by progressive, leftist values, I'm committed to leveraging technology for people, not capital.

## üöÄ Current Focus
- Exploring the depths of C++20!
- Venturing into the world of Flutter and Python (but mostly trying to master C++ first!)
- I'm building my lil projects, hoping they help people out!

## üå± Learning & Interests
- Expanding my programming language repertoire
- Game design concepts
- Industrial design and engineering solutions
- Tooling and practical inventions that are helpful for everyday people!
- [Making a better world!](https://youtu.be/U5Lxed3fW9E)

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

I'm actively working on developing ü•øpractical applicationsüß† that align with my values of sustainability, accessibility, and social equity. Here's a glimpse of what I'm working on:

- üé¨ **Video Editor**: Making a new video editor that is beginner friendly, and expands NLE tools for advanced, professional editors.

- üéÆ **UE5.4 RPG Game Project**: Open world, middle ages RPG with a few systems like stealth, factions, rivalries, etc. I got a prototype up and running but the systems need tweaking and better integration with each other before I show it off.

- üí≠ **Personal UE5.4 Game Project**: Just been thinking how I could translate my experiences in therapy clearing blocks and dissociative barriers into a game that could possibly teach others how to do the same thing. Tldr: just learn to describe the feeling (color, shape, texture, scent, temperature, anything!) and focus on it till it reduces in size down to nothing. Having fun making the levels that were in my head my whole life taunting me and making them into boss level mechanics lmao!

- üé® **Art Plugin**: Basically gonna take drawings and ink the pencil stuff to skip the "Inking" step, would be very helpful to a lot of my artist friends. Working with my friends to make it as helpful as possible. Currently planned as a plugin for existing programs like SAI and Photoshop, but that requires different APIs so its time intensive.

- ‚å®Ô∏è **Sarcastic Typing GUI**: Easy switch tHaT tUrNs yOuR tExT iNtO tHiS. tHaTs iT. Turns out security is very important, cuz typing is like that. So I am making sure its secure and safe to install, and as lightweight as possible.

- üöÄ **Various Practical and Fun Applications**: Some are more practical things, some are hardware solutions, some are dumb things! All will raise $100 Trillion Dollars because Wall Street is dumb.

## ü§ù Collaboration
I'm currently focused on solo projects, but I'm open to collaborating with like-minded individuals who share a passion for learning and constructive development. I'm particularly interested in projects that focus on environmental sustainability, accessibility, or empowering underrepresented communities. If you have an interesting project idea and a positive attitude, feel free to reach out!

# Personal Stuff!

## üåü Personal Interests (Outside of programmin')
- üí™ LOVE working out. My current 1rm deadlift is 515 lbs, regular 5x10 450 lbs conventional bar.
- üêæ Been a furry most of my life, more details below so I can link a silly photo in my Readme lmao
- üó®Ô∏è HUGE extrovert, actually had to delete several chat apps because I was spending so much time chatting on them it was taking up a ton of time.
- üéµ Making music! Working in Ableton 12, using:
  - üéπ Kontakt 7 KOMPLETE 14 STANDARD pack
  - üéª 8dio's Majestica Standard
  - üéõÔ∏è Xfer Records Serum
  - üéöÔ∏è ...and more I can't remember rn lmao
- üìö Reading! You can see more of my collection [at our LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/profile/aquaticus)! My father and I have a collection of 15k items from books to video games, tarot decks with little white books to art portfolios.

## üåü Philosophy
I believe in leveraging technology to create a more equitable and just society. My work is guided by progressive values, focusing on:

- üåé Environmental sustainability (All projects factor in KwH costs and similar variables to be [carbon negative](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot) overall)
- Inclusive and :accessibility: accessible technology (We will all be disabled one day if we are lucky enough to live that long. In the meantime, we should build a world that is inclusive to all and easier to access, no matter who you are.)
- Empowering marginalized and underrepresented communities through tech (It's making the internet better overall, so we all have a greater future together, which means üî® permanent fixes üõ†Ô∏è to the problems ‚ùóthat exist now.‚ùó)
- Challenging systemic inequalities in the tech industry and beyond, mostly by being better than existing firms and killing then replacing them with my firms focused on these progressive values, public benefit and long term sustainability. We've tried the short-term profit way, and its created our stupid current world. Lets try it my way instead, now.üòÅ

I'm committed to using my skills to contribute to projects and initiatives that align with these values and push for positive social change.

In terms of my projects, my golden rule is, well, ü•á[the golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)ü•á. But besides "Do unto others", its "Don't talk about what you're working on until its finished": I tend to blab, get praise for my ideas, and then... I'm good! Don't need to finish what I started, cuz I got what I wanted! Praise! Better to just keep things under wraps and plug away until its ready, hence my vagueness on projects. I wanna share, I do. But its better to have something worth showing off first than just say "Hey, look at this barely started thing! Love meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" and then it goes nowhere.

# üê∫ [My Fursonas](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/tktheanimal)
Each of these characters represents a facet of myself or just something from my imagination and life experiences. Some are alters within my DID system (Nic, Charlie, Peter Issac), while others represent ideas or stories I wanted to explore and flesh out more. I might make projects with some of them in the future.

Given how many fellow furs are into programming, I am very happy to share this facet of my life on my silly lil GitHub UwU! Click the photos to see the original reference sheets on FurAffinity to learn more about each guy UwU!
